About
============

custom-upload is a very simple [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) plugin to customize the HTML file upload button. With custom-upload, you can change the way the file upload button looks and add your own functionality for when files are selected.

Setup
============
```
<!-- Include jQuery -->
<script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></script>
<!-- Include prettyupload -->
<script src="prettyupload.js"></script>
```

Usage Example
=============

1. In your html, create a div having two elements:

   ```
   <div id="myuploader">
    <input type="file" class="prettyupload-uploader"/>
    <input type="button" class="prettyupload-trigger" value="Select files" />
   </div>
   ```

2. In your javascript, in jquery's dom-ready function, add the following code:

   ```
    $(function(){
      $('#myuploader').prettyupload();
    });
   ```

**With the above code, when you click 'Select files', a file chooser will open, but nothing will happen when you
select files. You can change that by adding the onChangeCallback option, as shown in the Options section below.**

Options
========

There are several options you can pass to prettyupload:

```
$(function(){
	$('#myuploader').prettyupload({
	
		/* 
		This is the selector for the <input type="file"/> element 
		inside your #myuploader element. By default, this is assumed 
		to be '.prettyupload-uploader'. 
		*/
		actualButton: '#uploader',
		
		/* 
		This is the selector for the element inside your #myuploader 
		element that is clicked to open the file chooser. By default,
		this is assumed to be '.prettyupload-trigger'.
		*/
		visibleButton: '#trigger',
		
		/*
		This is the function that will be called when files have been chosen. 
		The files parameter is an HTML5 FileList object, consisting of all 
		the files you've selected.
		*/
		onChangeCallback: function(files){
			// code
		} 
		
	});
});
```
